# Tic-Tac-Toe: Ruby, Code Submission

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made with Ruby. It has two game modes: single player and two player. 

The single player mode lets you play with the computer and the computer uses minimax algorithm to play
perfect moves. Therefore, it's impossible to beat the computer. Although, minimax does not guarantee a victory,
therefore, if the user plays a perfect game, then the game will be a draw.

The two player mode let's you play the game with a friend.Therefore, the program gives you an interface to play
although the players would be two different users and no artificial intelligence would be involved.
